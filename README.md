# Hypothesis Testing 

Welcome to the Hypothesis Testing Repository! This repository contains various hypothesis testing files for different statistical scenarios. Each file focuses on a specific type of hypothesis test, providing explanations and examples to help you understand and apply these tests effectively.

## Types of Hypothesis Testing Files

This repository includes the following hypothesis testing files:

1. **T-test.ipynb**: This file demonstrates how to perform a t-test, which is used to compare the means of two independent samples. It provides functions and examples to conduct both one-sample t-tests and two-sample t-tests.( A data file [airofit[https://github.com/Divyagoyal002/Hypothesis-Testing/blob/main/aerofit.csv] is also uploaded for the problem)

2. **Paired-T-Test.ipynb**: The paired_t_testing.py file explores the paired t-test, a statistical test used to compare the means of two related samples. It offers functions and examples for conducting paired t-tests and interpreting the results.

3. **Anova-Test.ipynb**: The anova_test.py file focuses on analysis of variance (ANOVA), a hypothesis test used to compare the means of more than two independent groups. It provides functions and examples for one-way ANOVA and two-way ANOVA.

4. **Correlation-Test.ipynb**: This file demonstrates how to perform correlation tests, such as Pearson's correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. It includes functions and examples for calculating and interpreting correlations between variables.

Please explore these files to learn more about each type of hypothesis test and how to apply them in different scenarios.

## Usage

To use this repository effectively, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Hypothesis-Testing.git
   ```

2. Explore the files: Navigate to the repository directory and explore the different hypothesis testing files. Each file is named descriptively, indicating the type of test it covers.

3. Read the documentation: Open the desired file in a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE), Jupyter Notebook is suggested for better experience  and carefully read the provided explanations, function definitions, and examples. Understand the purpose and usage of each hypothesis test.

4. Run the examples: Execute the provided examples in the file using a Python interpreter or by running the file directly. Observe the outputs and interpretations to solidify your understanding of how to apply the hypothesis tests.

5. Customize and apply to your own data: Modify the code and examples to fit your specific hypothesis testing needs. Replace the provided example data with your own dataset and apply the hypothesis tests accordingly.
